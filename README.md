# CS61A

## Introduction
- UCB CS 61 series is an introductory course in computer science that I think is perfect for zero-foundation beginners. CS61A, as the first lesson of this series of courses, focuses on the upper-level abstract thinking, allowing programmers to think about solutions in a way that suits the problem, while ignoring the underlying principles and low-level operations of the machine.
- This's my solution for **UCB CS 61A (Fall 2024)**, which includes hws, labs, discussions and projects, limited to learning and legitimate communication. 
- For each chapter, the learning sequence of discussion-lab-homework [- project] is highly recommended. Try to complete all **independently**.

## Prerequisites
Basic Python 3 programming language.

## Schedule for Fall 2024
I consider that learners can refer to the teaching schedule of Fall 2024 to arrange the learning sequence as follows:

If you independently and excellently complete the CS61A course, then you deserve to expand and improve the following courses:
- [UCB CS61B](https://sp24.datastructur.es/) : Data Structures and Algorithms.
- [UCB CS61C](https://cs61c.org/) : Great Ideas in Computer Architecture.
